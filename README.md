# post--activation-atlas

## Bugs

spread operator in object literals

format numbers in toolip

add hover state for notebooklink

detal.html and link to it somewhere

restore "no pan/zoom" options on atlas

cache assets

## Nice to haves

add "reset" to layer tour (and possible zoom buttons)

grid size radio buttons smaller

turn off tooltip on scroll

.npy data files

smooth zoom between gridsizes

## Done
add 3d slides for intro
no label shadow (or labels) when zooming or panning.
label only every nth cell if cells are too small
add poi tour to cover caption.
Make minimap draggable
quicklinks in multiple layers causes weird async loading issues. (this might be fixed)
add "settings tray" to bottom of minimap
turn off scroll wheel
one-layer initializes with animation. Others do too...
Colab notebooks
in options restrict gridsize to relevant levels.
Fix zoom.html
mousewheel and touch zoom support
autochoose gridsize (this is questionable?)
move hovercard to root so can get around the css contain problem.
first image of paths is still missing.
activation atlas button gets cut off
pre-render thumbnails
add different filtering strategies in article
tighten up verticallayerannotations.html
pre-render static atlases
too many atlases sometimes causing loading problems?
Add support for css resizing lazycomponent.
Add width variable to lazyComponent.
