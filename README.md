# post--activation-atlas

## Bugs

in options restrict gridsize to relevant levels.

move hovercard to root so can get around the css contain problem.

too many atlases sometimes causing loading problems?

# Tweaks

tighten up verticallayerannotations.html

mousewheel and touch zoom support

detal.html and link to it somewhere

pre-render static atlases

smooth zoom between gridsizes

no label shadow (or labels) when zooming or panning.

Add support for css resizing lazycomponent.
Add width variable to lazyComponent.

one-layer initializes with a zero width, causing animation.

## Todos

Fix zoom.html

Colab notebooks

add different filtering strategies in playground
by rank, by magnitude

autochoose gridsize

label only every nth cell if cells are too small

add 3d slides for intro

## Done

first image of paths is still missing.
activation atlas button gets cut off
pre-render thumbnails
add different filtering strategies in article
