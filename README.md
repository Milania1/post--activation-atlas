Colab notebooks

# Tweaks

Fix zoom.html
mousewheel and touch zoom support

add "reset" to layer tour (and possible zoom buttons)

detal.html and link to it somewhere

label only every nth cell if cells are too small

smooth zoom between gridsizes
autochoose gridsize

no label shadow (or labels) when zooming or panning.

Add support for css resizing lazycomponent.
Add width variable to lazyComponent.

one-layer initializes with a zero width, causing animation. Others do too...

## Todos

add different filtering strategies in playground
by rank, by magnitude

add 3d slides for intro

## Done

first image of paths is still missing.
activation atlas button gets cut off
pre-render thumbnails
add different filtering strategies in article
tighten up verticallayerannotations.html
pre-render static atlases
too many atlases sometimes causing loading problems?
