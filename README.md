# post--activation-atlas

## Bugs

in options restrict gridsize to relevant levels.

quicklinks in multiple layers causes weird async loading issues.

Make minimap a little bigger

Colab notebooks

Fix zoom.html
mousewheel and touch zoom support

# Tweaks

add "reset" to layer tour (and possible zoom buttons)

detal.html and link to it somewhere

smooth zoom between gridsizes
autochoose gridsize

no label shadow (or labels) when zooming or panning.
label only every nth cell if cells are too small

one-layer initializes with a zero width, causing animation. Others do too...

## Todos

Add support for css resizing lazycomponent.
Add width variable to lazyComponent.

add different filtering strategies in playground
by rank, by magnitude

add 3d slides for intro

## Done
move hovercard to root so can get around the css contain problem.
first image of paths is still missing.
activation atlas button gets cut off
pre-render thumbnails
add different filtering strategies in article
tighten up verticallayerannotations.html
pre-render static atlases
too many atlases sometimes causing loading problems?
