# post--activation-atlas

## Bugs

quicklinks in multiple layers causes weird async loading issues.

Make minimap a little bigger

smooth zoom between gridsizes

# Tweaks

add "reset" to layer tour (and possible zoom buttons)

detal.html and link to it somewhere

no label shadow (or labels) when zooming or panning.
label only every nth cell if cells are too small

## Nice to haves

add "settings tray" to bottom of minimap

add 3d slides for intro

add different filtering strategies in playground
by rank, by magnitude -- this might not be possible due to averaging

## Done
one-layer initializes with animation. Others do too...
Colab notebooks
in options restrict gridsize to relevant levels.
Fix zoom.html
mousewheel and touch zoom support
autochoose gridsize (this is questionable?)
move hovercard to root so can get around the css contain problem.
first image of paths is still missing.
activation atlas button gets cut off
pre-render thumbnails
add different filtering strategies in article
tighten up verticallayerannotations.html
pre-render static atlases
too many atlases sometimes causing loading problems?
Add support for css resizing lazycomponent.
Add width variable to lazyComponent.
